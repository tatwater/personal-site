instructions:
  - step: Preheat oven to 325°F and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.
  - step: 'In a small bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch and salt and set aside.'
  - step: >-
      In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream butter and sugar together until it’s
      light and fluffy. Add the egg and vanilla extract. Beat until combined.
  - step: >-
      Add the flour mixture and mix using low speed, scraping the sides of the
      bowl as needed, just until it’s combined and forms a dough.
  - step: >
      Place dough in a gallon resealable bag. Use scissors to snip the tip so
      the cut measures about ¾” across.
  - step: 'Pipe dough in 2" segments, about 2" apart.'
  - step: >-
      Bake the cookies for 15 minutes, one sheet at a time. The edges should be
      golden when done. Let them cool completely on a wire rack. They will crisp
      up as they cool.
  - step: >-
      Once the cookies are cool, pair them up by size so you have nice, neat
      sandwiches.
  - step: >-
      Place the chocolate morsels and heavy cream in a small bowl. Microwave for
      30 seconds at 50 percent power and stir. Repeat once or twice more and
      stir until completely smooth. Make sure to stir well between each heating
      interval and be careful not to scorch the chocolate mixture.
  - step: Spread the ganache on one cookie and sandwich with the other.
notes:
  - note: >-
      For minty cookies, substitute vanilla extract for 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
      and 1/2 tsp mint extract
