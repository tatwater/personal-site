instructions:
  - step: >-
      Mix 1 1/2 tbsp brown sugar, 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup hoisin sauce, 3 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp five-spice powder, 1 tbsp vegetable or canola oil, and (optionally) 2 tsp red food coloring or 2 tbsp red bean curd in a medium bowl.
  - step: Cut pork into long, flat, 1"-thick slices for better flavor penetration.
  - step: Place the pork and marinade in a stain proof container or resealable bag.
  - step: Marinate 24 to 48 hours in the fridge.
  - step: Preheat oven to 320°F.
  - step: Line a tray with foil and place a rack on top.
  - step: Remove pork from marinade and place on rack. Set marinade aside.
  - step: Roast for 30 minutes.
  - step: >-
      Pour reserved marinade in a small saucepan. Mix in 2 tbsp honey. Bring to simmer over medium high and cook for 2 minutes until syrupy. Remove from heat.
  - step: >-
      Remove pork from oven. Dab marinade all over, then turn. Baste then roast for a further 30 minutes.
  - step: >-
      Remove pork from oven. Brush with marinade again, then turn, brush with marinade and roast for a further 20 minutes. If charring too quickly, cover with foil.
  - step: >-
      Baste again on surface then bake for a further 10 minutes until caramelised and sticky. Meat should be tender but not falling apart, like with pulled pork. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.
notes:
  - note: 'TENDERLOIN: Roast at 350°F for 25 minutes or until internal temperature is 160°F. Around halfway through roasting, baste generously with the reserved Marinade. Then broil on high for a few minutes until surface is charred and glossy, basting once or twice.'
