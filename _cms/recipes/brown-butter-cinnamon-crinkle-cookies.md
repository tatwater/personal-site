instructions:
  - step: >-
      Place the butter in a saucepan. Cook over medium heat until the butter
      melts and begins to foam. Continue to cook, whisking (or swirling the pan)
      frequently until the butter becomes an amber color, this should take 2-3
      minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to cool slightly.
  - step: >-
      Whisk together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt in a medium
      bowl and set aside.
  - step: >-
      Add the granulated and brown sugar into the bowl of your stand mixer
      fitted with the paddle attachment. Pour the cooled butter into the sugars
      and mix on medium speed to combine. Add in the eggs and vanilla, mixing
      just until smooth.
  - step: >-
      Turn the mixer to low and slowly add in the flour mixture until just
      incorporated. Cover the mixing bowl and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
  - step: >-
      Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or
      parchment paper. Set aside.
  - step: >-
      Place the powdered sugar in a shallow bowl. Divide the chilled dough into
      1-2 tablespoon-sized balls (I use a #40 ice cream scoop). Roll each ball
      into the powdered sugar and place onto the prepared sheet, about 2 inches
      apart.
  - step: Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the cookies are set.
  - step: >-
      Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for a few minutes before transferring
      them to a wire rack to finish cooling.
