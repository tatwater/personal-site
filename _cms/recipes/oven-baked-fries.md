instructions: >-
  1. Cut potatoes into desired size and shape. I recommend leaving the skin on
  and slicing into thick batons about 1/2" across, but removing the skin or
  cutting into wedges, crinkles, curly fries, shoestrings, etc are all great
  options.


  2. Place potato slices into a colander and sprinkle with sugar. Set aside
  until liquid is released from potatoes, about 20-30 minutes. Drain liquid and
  pat fries dry.


  3. Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray
  with cooking spray.


  4. Mix potato slices, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black
  pepper together in either a large bowl or a resealable bag until evenly
  coated. Save the rosemary for later.


  5. Spread the coated potato slices in a single layer on the prepared baking
  sheet.


  6. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip fries and bake for until
  crisp and browned, about 20 more minutes.




  **Notes**


  \- The sugar releases juices in the potatoes and helps them get crisp in the
  oven.


  \- _Not tested: Soak potato slices in water for an hour or so to reduce
  internal fry fluffiness._
