instructions:
  - step: Cut potatoes into desired size and shape. I recommend leaving the skin on and slicing into thick batons about 1/2" across, but removing the skin or cutting into wedges, crinkles, curly fries, shoestrings, etc are all great options.
  - step: Place potato slices into a colander and sprinkle with sugar. Set aside until liquid is released from potatoes, about 20-30 minutes. Drain liquid and pat fries dry.
  - step: Preheat oven to 425Â°F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.
  - step: Mix potato slices, olive oil, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and black pepper together in either a large bowl or a resealable bag until evenly coated. Save the rosemary for later.
  - step: Spread the coated potato slices in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet.
  - step: Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Flip fries and bake for until crisp and browned, about 20 more minutes.
notes:
  - note: The sugar releases juices in the potatoes and helps them get crisp in the oven.
  - note: 'Not tested: Soak potato slices in water for an hour or so to reduce internal fry fluffiness.'
